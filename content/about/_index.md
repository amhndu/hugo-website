I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at [PaveAI](https://www.paveai.com/), writing Rust and Python

I [build](/projects/) things and once in a blue moon I try to [write](/blog/).

I know you are dying to know my editor and operating system preferences, so let's cut to the chase:
vim and Arch with [KDE/Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop) is my weapon of choice.  

When I'm not programming, I play Table Tennis, watch anime
(I'm especially a fan of KyoAni productions, Hunter x Hunter, the Monogatari series and Fate/Zero. I'm always watching a few seasonals!) or listen to music
