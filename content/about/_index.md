I'm a student currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science at IIIT Jabalpur.  
I [build](/projects/) things and once in a blue moon I try to [write](/blog/).

I know you are dying to know my editor and operating system preferences, so let's cut to the chase:
vim and an [Arch-derivative](https://antergos.com) with [KDE/Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop) is my preferred environment.  

When I'm not programming, I play Table Tennis, watch anime
(I'm especially a fan of KyoAni productions, Hunter x Hunter, the Monogatari series and Fate/Zero. I'm always watching a few seasonals!) or listen to music (I'm into indie EDM and all sorts of rock! Djent/progressive rock being my current fancy)
