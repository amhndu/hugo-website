I'm currently working as a Software Engineer, writing Rust and Python.
I enjoy solving problems and building software that are both pragmatic yet elegant. 
You can find my projects and contributions [here](/projects/) and the handful of posts I've written [here](/blog/). 

[Contact me]({{< ref "/#contact" >}} "Contact Me") if you'd like to hire me!
