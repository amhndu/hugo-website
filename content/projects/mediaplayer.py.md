I wrote this script some years ago to show currently playing music on conky.
I also used this to bind some mediaplayer keys from Openbox to control playback and volume.

Download it here: https://github.com/amhndu/conky-cards/blob/master/mediaplayer.py

This is most likely in need of some re-write.
Mostly because I'm a better programmer now compared to when I wrote it 4 years ago and the code is hard to look at currently.
